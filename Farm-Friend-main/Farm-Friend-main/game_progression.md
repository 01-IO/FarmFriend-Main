# Script and Game Progression
## Group 134

### I) Plot:

The game revolves around a 24-year-old young guy named "Nakul", who works as a Software Engineer in an urban area, and for this summer, decides to go back to his traditional roots and reaches his village.

Upon reaching his village, Nakul interacts with his grandparents and tries to understand their way of life, which is farming. However, upon observing the villagers, Nakul observes that the way farming was done was potentially risky, especially when it came to stubble burning. Nakul realizes that something must be done in order to steer his village in the right direction when it comes to farming.

### II) Game Progression:

The game comprises of 4 Levels. Each level comprises of a farming activity that aims to tackle the issue of stubble burning, and involves the player to move his character, do the necessary farming activity and proceed to the next level.

#### Level 1: Crop Residue Management
##### Objective: 
Introduce the player to the concept of crop residue management as an alternative to stubble burning.

##### Scenario: 
The player's character is tasked with collecting crop residues (stubble) from the field after harvest. Instead of burning the residues, they must find ways to manage them effectively.

##### Task:
The player must navigate the field and collect crop residues using a tractor or manual tools. They then have to transport the residues to a designated area for further processing.

##### Outcome:
Successfully managing crop residues introduces the player to the idea that stubble can be utilized beneficially rather than burned.

#### Level 2: Mulching Demonstration
##### Objective: 
Teach the player how to use crop residues for mulching to improve soil health and prevent stubble burning.

##### Scenario:
The player's character attends a demonstration on mulching conducted by a local agricultural expert. They learn about the benefits of mulching and how it helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and enhance soil fertility.

##### Task:
The player must practice mulching by spreading crop residues on designated areas of the field using appropriate equipment. They must ensure even coverage and proper incorporation of residues into the soil surface.

##### Outcome:
Successfully mastering mulching techniques equips the player with a valuable skill to prevent stubble burning and improve soil health.

#### Level 3: Cover Crop Planting
##### Objective:
Guide the player in planting cover crops to utilize crop residues and prevent stubble burning during fallow periods.

##### Scenario:
The player's character is tasked with planting cover crops in the field during the fallow period between main crop seasons. They learn about the benefits of cover crops in preventing soil erosion, suppressing weeds, and adding organic matter to the soil.

##### Task:
The player must select appropriate cover crop species and plant them in the field using seeding equipment. They must ensure proper seed spacing and depth for optimal germination and growth.

##### Outcome:
Successfully planting cover crops demonstrates to the player how to utilize crop residues effectively to prevent stubble burning and maintain soil health year-round.

#### Level 4: Integrated Livestock Grazing
##### Objective:
Introduce the player to integrated livestock grazing as a sustainable method to manage crop residues and prevent stubble burning.

##### Scenario:
The player's character collaborates with local farmers to implement an integrated crop-livestock system on the farm. They learn about the benefits of allowing livestock to graze on crop residues in the field.

##### Task:
The player must coordinate the movement of livestock into the field to graze on crop residues while ensuring minimal damage to crops and soil. They must monitor the grazing intensity and duration to maximize residue utilization without compromising future crop productivity.

##### Outcome:
Successfully implementing integrated livestock grazing demonstrates to the player how to manage crop residues sustainably, prevent stubble burning, and enhance farm productivity through a diversified farming approach.

These four levels provide a progressive learning experience for the player, focusing on farming tasks that prevent stubble burning while promoting sustainable agriculture practices. Each level introduces new concepts and skills, building upon the previous ones to equip the player with knowledge and abilities to address the issue effectively.
